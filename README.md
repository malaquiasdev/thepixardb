# ThePixarDB

**ThePixarDB** is an centralized database of the feature filmes, short filmes, collections, actors, directors and much more. We have all the data you'll ever need in one place, easily accessible through with a modern RESTful API.

**It is unofficial and we are made by fans to fans.**

This project is a RESTful API and will be a GraphQL API too.

## Setup Local - Docker and Compose üñ•Ô∏è

We are using docker for create a local environment. The process is managed by Docker Compose.

This setup it's not recommend to create a production environment, for that we have a terraform module inside of the infra folder.

You can start everthing by:

```bash
make setup-local
```

Or if you don't have **make** on your machine you can use:

```bash
docker-compose up
....
```
